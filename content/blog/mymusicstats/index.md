## Introduction:  
My first ever attempt at writing JavaScript code.

MyMusicStats is a web-app to dive deep into your Last.fm stats. Simply enter your Last.fm username & press Submit button. Written purely in JavaScript, the app works on the client side, so no data is saved or collected. There is no backend server to process data.

## Features:
* Quickly & comprehensively visualise your music data.
* Discover interesting information about your listening habits.
* No data collected or saved.
* Open source with no ads.
* Can be installed as a PWA (Progressive Web App).
* Pure JavaScript & HTML. No backend server involved.
* Superfast & lightweight.
* Fully responsive. Looks great on mobile devices.
* Beautiful card view with delightful animations.
* Interactive & responsive charts.
* Unique-O-Meter - See how unique your music taste is.
