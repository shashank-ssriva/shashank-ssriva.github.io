Hi, Welcome to my personal home page hosted on GitHub. I am a DevOps Architect by profession & have been
in the industry for more than 12 years.  
Thanks to DevOps, I have managed to work on a wide variety of tools & technologies. I come from the Unix/Linux background & I take pride in having worked on Solaris & HP UX (long back!).  
When I am not sitting in front of a laptop, I spend my time listening to music or watching my favorite shows.  I also like to travel.  
I love building web-apps using JavaScript & Python/Flask.
